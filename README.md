# Custom Grid

Custom grid for layouts using Flexbox, Calc() and SASS

## WTF is this?

Based on Kevin Powell's video [Create a Custom Grid System with CSS Calc() and Sass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fAqATYEr0&t=201s) 
I built a custom layout grid.

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS

## What I learned
* How to make a hamburger menu navbar using CSS using span and ::before/after classes
* Using checkbox and styling it for use in navbars is handy
* How to create cool underline hover effect using ::before pseudo-classes
* How to use media querys with Sass @content
* How to customize Font-awesome 

## Problems/Mistakes
* No Problems
