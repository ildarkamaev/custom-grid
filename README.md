# Custom Grid

Custom grid for layouts using Flexbox, Calc() and SASS

## WTF is this?

Based on Kevin Powell's video [Create a Custom Grid System with CSS Calc() and Sass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fAqATYEr0&t=201s) 
I built a custom layout grid.

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS

## What I learned
* How to create custom 12-col grid
* How to use SASS @for to create grid automatically

## Problems/Mistakes
* No Problems



## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
